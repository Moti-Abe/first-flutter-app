# Moti-flutter-app 🚀

Welcome to my first Flutter project!

**Moti-flutter-app** is my first Flutter mobile application — built as part of my journey into mobile development using Flutter and Dart. This project explores the fundamentals of building cross-platform apps with Flutter, including UI creation, navigation, and basic app structure.

## 📌 Features

- Basic Flutter setup for a cross-platform app
- Exploration of Dart language and Flutter widgets
- Ready for future feature expansions
- Supports Android, iOS, web, and desktop (Windows / macOS / Linux)

## 🛠️ Built With

This project uses:

- **Flutter** — UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications
- **Dart** — Programming language optimized for apps
- _(Add more libraries and packages here once you start using them!)_

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### 📋 Prerequisites
